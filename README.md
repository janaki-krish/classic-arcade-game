### How to Play
	- Use the arrow keys to move the player to the other end
	- The game starts with player having 3 lives. If the player loses all the 3 lives, the game is over
	- Avoid player being killed by enemies. If the player and enemy bug collides, the player moves back to original position and loses a life

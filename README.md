# Classic Arcade Game Clone

## Project Overview

	Part of Udacity FrontEnd Web Development Nanodegree. The idea is to recreate the classic arcade game with provided visual assets - player, enemies

### How to Run
	- Clone or download the repository link https://github.com/janaki-krish/classic-arcade-game
	- Open index.html to start the game
	
### How to Play
	- Use the arrow keys to move the player to the other end
	- The game starts with player having 3 lives. 
	- Avoid player being killed by enemies. If the player and enemy bug collides, the player moves back to original position and loses a life.
	- If the player loses all the 3 lives, the game is over.
	- Theres an option to restart the game once it is over.
